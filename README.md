## üåå Inspiration

We were inspired by the UofTHacks X theme, **Exploration**, propelling us to create a game that invites players to traverse diverse rooms, solving puzzles and unveiling secrets. Our mission extended beyond gameplay, as we explored the vast landscapes of game development, VR, and the Metaverse.

## üéØ What it Does

**Escape Room** is a heart-pounding multiplayer VR adventure, encouraging players to collaborate, explore, and conquer challenges together. Race against time, decipher puzzles, and achieve specific objectives within the confines of our captivating virtual rooms.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It

Harnessing the power of Unity and the creativity of our team, we brought **Escape Room** to life. With assets from the Unity Asset Store and the magic of GitHub collaboration, we sculpted 3D wonders. Multiplayer magic was conjured using the Photon engine, while the immersive VR experience was crafted with the OpenXR plugin for Unity.

## üöÄ Challenges Faced

Our journey was not without obstacles. Setting up VR devices proved to be a daunting challenge, but persistence led us to compatible solutions. Overcoming our initial lack of game development experience, we embraced online tutorials, rapidly learning the intricacies of game design.

## üèÜ Accomplishments

We take pride in our achievement of implementing seamless multiplayer functionality via the Photon engine. Venturing into the uncharted territories of VR without prior experience, we successfully navigated the OpenXR toolkit, creating an immersive gaming experience for all.

## üß† What We Learned

The hackathon became our classroom, teaching us Unity, C# programming, and the art of collaboration through GitHub. We mastered the intricacies of the Photon engine, enabling dynamic multiplayer gameplay, and delved into the immersive universe of VR using the OpenXR plugin.

## üîÆ What's Next for Escape Room

The adventure doesn't end here! In the future, we plan to empower users to design their own rooms and craft custom puzzles, enhancing the game's versatility. Prepare for a journey filled with diverse and challenging puzzles, all designed to captivate your senses. We are committed to refining the user experience, optimizing performance, and ensuring every moment in **Escape Room** is seamless and unforgettable.
