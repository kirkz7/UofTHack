# Escape Room - UofTHacks X Project

Escape Room is a first-person, multiplayer VR game developed during the UofTHacks X hackathon. The game challenges players to explore rooms, discover clues, solve puzzles, and accomplish tasks within a limited timeframe. It was inspired by the theme of Exploration, and our team aimed to explore the realms of game development, Metaverse, and Virtual Reality (VR) within the intense 36-hour hackathon period. For more detail about the project, please check out our [post](https://devpost.com/software/escape-room-7bnspl).


## Inspiration

We were inspired by the UofTHacks X theme, Exploration, which led us to create a game that requires players to explore various rooms, solve puzzles, and uncover hidden clues. Additionally, our team wanted to explore the world of game development, especially in the context of VR and Metaverse technologies.

## What it Does

Escape Room is a multiplayer VR game that allows players to work together to uncover clues and solve puzzles within different rooms. The game encourages exploration and collaboration, challenging players to accomplish specific goals within a limited time.

## How We Built It

We used Unity as our development platform and leveraged assets from the Unity Asset Store to create the 3D models and animations for our game. GitHub was utilized for project management and collaboration. To enable multiplayer functionality, we integrated the Photon engine, and for VR development, we employed the OpenXR plugin in Unity.

## Challenges Faced

One major challenge we encountered was setting up VR devices. We used Valve Index, which required DisplayPort output, but our laptop only supported HDMI input. After extensive searching and asking for help, we managed to find a compatible adapter.

Another hurdle was our lack of experience in game development. However, we overcame this obstacle by following tutorials on YouTube, allowing us to quickly grasp the basics of game development and successfully implement our ideas.

## Accomplishments

We are proud of achieving multiplayer functionality in our game by quickly learning and implementing the Photon engine. Additionally, creating a VR game using the OpenXR toolkit without prior experience in game development was a significant accomplishment for our team.

## What We Learned

Throughout the hackathon, we learned Unity and C# programming through online resources. We also gained valuable knowledge about the Photon engine for enabling multiplayer gameplay and the OpenXR plugin for VR development. Managing our project on GitHub taught us essential collaboration and version control skills.

## What's Next for Escape Room

In the future, we plan to allow users to design their own rooms and create custom puzzles. We aim to expand the game by adding more diverse and challenging puzzles. Furthermore, we are committed to enhancing the overall user experience, focusing on optimizing performance and ensuring seamless gameplay.
